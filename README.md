## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced my knowledge of using **Flexbox** for building responsive layouts. One key takeaway was ensuring that elements resize and align correctly across different screen sizes.


### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to improve the following:

- **CSS Grid**: Learn how to integrate Grid with Flexbox for more complex layouts.
- **Animations**: Implement subtle hover and focus animations for interactive elements.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This was a great reference to understand and apply Flexbox properties effectively.
